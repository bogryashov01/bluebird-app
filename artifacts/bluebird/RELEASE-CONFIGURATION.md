# Bluebird iOS release configuration

This note records the owner-provided values needed before an iOS production build and App Store submission. No app identity, EAS project, credentials, or production environment values are created here.

## Current readiness audit (2026-10-20)

- The checked-in EAS `production` profile explicitly selects the named
  `production` environment and store distribution. It does not extend either
  Development profile. This verifies the profile selection only, not the
  values stored in Expo/EAS.
- This workspace has no production values for the three Main API variables
  below. The connected Replit environment does not expose the owner's remote
  EAS production environment, so its values, visibility, and access controls
  remain unverified. No production request was made.
- Mobile Main API selection is explicit: only the selected environment's
  matching API URL and Clerk key are consumed. The production API URL is
  restricted to the existing canonical HTTPS `/api` endpoint; Development,
  Preview, legacy API, and wrong Clerk-key-type values fail configuration
  validation rather than becoming Main API fallbacks.
- Production Clerk sign-in is not enabled by the current Mobile auth
  configuration: the mounted Clerk flow is explicitly Development-only. A
  configured `pk_live_` value alone would not enable production authentication.
  Keep production auth unavailable until its separate owner approval and
  Mobile implementation are completed; do not turn on the Development flag or
  reuse its key.
- The legacy generated API client can also receive `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`.
  Because the remote EAS values could not be inspected, the owner must verify
  that the Production EAS environment does not point this legacy base URL at a
  Development or Replit Preview service. This is an external configuration
  verification blocker, not evidence that such a value is currently set.

## Production EAS environment

Configure the named EAS `production` environment with these public app-configuration variables:

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_BLUEBIRD_API_ENVIRONMENT` must select `production`.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_BLUEBIRD_PRODUCTION_API_BASE_URL` must identify the Production Main Bluebird API. The mobile configuration accepts only its configured canonical HTTPS `/api` endpoint.
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_BLUEBIRD_PRODUCTION_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` must be the Production Clerk publishable key (`pk_live_…`) for the Clerk instance paired with that API.

The API URL, environment selector, and Clerk publishable key are embedded in the mobile app configuration; they are not server secrets. The publishable key is public by design but must belong to the correct Production Clerk instance. Do not put private keys, API tokens, or other server credentials in `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variables or in this repository. Keep any genuine secrets in an approved secret store.

## Owner inputs required

- Confirm the exact unique reverse-DNS iOS bundle identifier and set `expo.ios.bundleIdentifier` in `app.json`. It is intentionally unset; do not derive it from the app name or website.
- Supply the App Store Connect app's numeric Apple ID (`ascAppId`) if submission should be non-interactive. No App Store Connect app ID is available in this project.
- Provide authorized Apple Developer / App Store Connect access and configure signing/submission credentials through EAS when the owner is ready. Do not commit Apple credentials or add guessed team/account values here.
- Create or link the EAS project only after the owner approves the app identity and project ownership. No EAS project ID is configured.

The `submit.production` profile intentionally leaves `ios` values empty until those owner inputs are available; EAS Submit can prompt for missing values interactively.

## Before an owner-authorized TestFlight build

1. In the organization-owned Expo account, inspect the `production` EAS
   environment and verify the API URL, environment selector, and live Clerk
   key belong to the approved Production API/Clerk pair. Also inspect
   `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`; remove it if unused or verify its approved Production
   destination. Do not paste values into chat or commit them.
2. Confirm the Production Clerk/API pairing with their authorized owners.
   The checked-in canonical URL and a `pk_live_` prefix are validation rules,
   not proof that the remote Clerk instance or API owner approved that pairing.
3. Provide and approve the exact iOS bundle identifier and organization-owned
   EAS project ID. Configure Apple signing and App Store Connect access only
   through the owner's approved EAS/Apple workflow.
4. Separately approve and implement Production Clerk authentication before
   expecting sign-in or member data in TestFlight. No Production sign-in,
   legacy-host fallback, or Development configuration should be enabled as a
   substitute.
5. Confirm the app version/build number and Universal Link association with
   the owner, then run a future owner-authorized iOS build/device-validation
   task. This audit started no build, upload, or submission.
